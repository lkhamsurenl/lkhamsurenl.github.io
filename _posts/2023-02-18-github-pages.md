In this post, I'm gonna summarize my main takeaways from Bogleheads investment principles.


## BLUF

* Pay off any debt as soon as possible (exception to low interest rate ones like mortgage)
* Maintain 6 months living expense worth of emergency savings
* Ensure you are taking advantage of employer 401k match (free money)
* Keep investing simple and boring:
  * No need to time the market and chase marginal returns.
  * You can achieve 90 percentile return (after tax & fee) performance with simple index funds.

## Investing

### Investing prioritization

1. Emergency fund
1. 401k match
1. Pay off credit card debt
1. HSA
1. 401k, Roth IRA contributions
1. Pay off student, car loans
1. Invest in taxable accounts
1. Mortgage


### Asset allocation

Rough guideline on asset allocation options:

* 25-40: US - 70%, INT - 15%, Bond - 15%
* 40-60: US - 50%, INT - 10%, Bond - 20%, Tips - 20%
* 60-80: US - 30%, INT - 10%, Bond - 30%, Tips - 30%
* 80+: US - 20%, Bond - 40%, Tips - 40%


**Note**: At the moment, my asset allocation is US - 60%, INT - 20%, BOND - 10%, ABNB - 10%


### Fidelity 3-fund portfolio

https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Fidelity is a great resource for general guideline on Fidelity.

My personal preference:

* US: FXAIX
* INT: FTIHX
* BOND: FXNAX


### Minimizing tax footprints

* Use Roth IRA contribution to take advantage of after-tax contribution (no tax on withdrawal)
  * Make sure to allocate high growth assets (i.e. stocks not bond) in Roth account to take advantage of tax-free growth
* Place Bonds in tax advantaged accounts (401k) and avoid placing them in taxable accounts
* Think of asset allocation in aggregate level across all accounts, not at the individual account level. It is ok
to have Bonds in one 401k account and allocate stocks in taxable.
