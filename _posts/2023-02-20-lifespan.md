## TLDR

* Eat less
* Avoid sugar, meat, and processed food (including processed carbs)
* Exercise
* Metformin / berberine for anti-aging
* Use retinoid once a week for prevent wrinkles
* You cannot improve what you cannot measure


## Eat less

Fasting is key mechanism in modern times to let your body activate its defense. Great starting place is to simply 
avoid snacking and being full all the time. By being hungry, we activate our anti-aging genes. 

Multiple fasting options:

* Time-restricted eating - Skip breakfast first, then eventually also lunch (so eating 1 / day)
* Once a week intermittent fasting - Water only fasting on Saturdays to give your body reset

## Foods to avoid

The most important point is to avoid sugar and limit carbs. Keeping your blood glucose steady is extremely important 
for longevity and prevent lifestyle related diseases. Here, I used Freestyle Libre 2 CGM (Continuous Glucose Montoring) 
via [ageless.rx](https://agelessrx.com/), you can read my learnings in a separate [post]({% post_url 2023-02-01-CGM %}).

Other takeaways on foods to limit:

* Processed foods (flour, white rice, outmeal, fast food, packaged foods, etc)
* Meat (fish seems to be somewhat exception due to Omega-3)

## Exercise for longevity

Combination of cardio and strength training is known to increase lifespan and promote health living. It is critical
to train your hips and larger muscles.

## Metformin and berberine

Metformin has been used for diabetes treatment for a long time (It's persription only in US). Berberine is supplement.
Those 2 drugs seem to work roughly the same way: activate AMPK, improve insulin sensitivity, and reduce blood glucose.

There are trials ([example](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34421827/)) showing early results on metformin's potential
benefits on increasing lifespan outside diabetes.

## Healthy skin

* Do not smoke or drink - both are terrible for your skin health
* Retinoid is effective for preventing wrinkles but long term effect on longevity is unknown. Best to keep it 1 / week
regime for now
* Use sunscreen everyday
* Measure Vitamin-D levels every year to avoid deficiency due to constant sunscreen use

## Measure what you can

Ultimately, I need to take control of my health and focus on prevention. Unfortunately, US healthcare system is setup
on foundation that treats patients once sick rather than preventing onset of disease.

By measuring, I know what works and what doesn't. Great example here is my experimentation with GCM, where I
learned foods I've been eating everyday (latte, oatmeal, bread, etc) were consistently spiking my blood glucose.
