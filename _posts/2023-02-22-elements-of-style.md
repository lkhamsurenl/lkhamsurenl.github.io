Following are main rules for effective English writing.

* In a series of 3 or more terms with a single conjunction, use a comman after the each term except the last
  * red, white, and blue
* Use ; for independent sentences with related content.
* Use paragraph as unit of composition. Do not have more than 1 topic in a paragraph.
* Use active voice.
* Use positive form: avoid using hesitant, non-committal language.
* Use definitive, specific language: numbers, concrete details over generic language.
* Remove unnecessary words. After writing down a document, look for ways to reduce any extra words / sentences.
