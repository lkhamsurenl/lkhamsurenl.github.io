Over the 2 weeks period between 2023-01-06 and 2023-01-18, I have used Freestyle Libre 2 CGM (Continuous Glucose
Monitoring) device to learn more about how my body responds to food and lifestyle choices. In this post, I am
going to summarize my main learnings.

## Background

**Why do this experiment?**

Before COVID, last time I've tested my A1C level was in December of 2019 and value was 5.4, which is not concerning
but also not super encouraging given the fact that value over 5.7 is considered pre-diabetes.

Access to healthcare was somewhat limited during peak COVID times of 2020-20221, so I've not bothered with going
for annual check-up. Once things started to settle, I did go for annual check-up and one of the first things I asked
my PCP was to test my A1C to ensure it has not gotten worse. Unfortunately it has gone actually quite worse: 5.9

I knew it was possible that it could have gotten worse, but still came as surprise. My diet has not changed much during
this time period and I largely do not consume any added sugar, desserts, and soda drinks etc (duh stuff).

My PCP recommended I try out some lifestyle interventions to lower my blood sugar. Specific recommendation I was given:

* Avoid high sugar fruits
* Eat more fiber
* Exercise more

I have tried what was recommended for few months and did A1C test again, but unfortunately was not getting any meaningful
improvements:

At this point, I was getting increasingly frustrated with the result and wanted to really understand why it is still
high even after those changes I introduced, hence CGM.

**How to get access to CGM?**

You need persription (at least in US) to get one of those FreeStyle Libre devices. In my case, I used company called
[Ageless](https://agelessrx.com/). It might have costed bit extra compared to getting it through your PCP, but
I just wanted quick and easy access, so worked out for me.

## Learnings

* Rice and bread were terrible for my glucose levels - consistently spiked me every single time
* Latte
* Bad food early in the day can ruin BG for the rest of the day
* Some innocous sounding takeout food can have large spike
* Foods that worked best: chia pudding, salad, veggie chili, salmon brocolli,
* There was a statistically significant drop in BG on days I've worked out vs days I did not
