Over the two-week period between January 6, 2023, and January 18, 2023, I used the Freestyle Libre 2 CGM
(Continuous Glucose Monitoring) device to better understand how my body responds to food and lifestyle choices.
Here, I’ll summarize my key learnings.

## Background

**Why do this experiment?**

Before COVID, the last time I tested my A1C level was in December 2019. At that time, my A1C was 5.4%—not concerning,
but also not ideal, as values above 5.7% are considered pre-diabetic.

During the peak of COVID-19 (2020–2021), access to healthcare was limited, and I skipped annual check-ups. When things
normalized, I resumed my routine medical visits. My first priority was testing my A1C to ensure it hadn’t worsened.
Unfortunately, the result showed a notable increase to **5.9%**.

While I expected some changes, this result was surprising since my diet hadn’t significantly changed.
I don’t consume that much added sugars, desserts, or sodas and generally follow “common sense” dietary guidelines.

My primary care physician (PCP) suggested some lifestyle interventions to lower my blood sugar:

- Avoid high-sugar fruits
- Eat more fiber
- Exercise more

I followed these recommendations for several months and repeated the A1C test, but my results didn’t improve significantly.

At this point, I felt increasingly frustrated and decided to better understand the factors behind my blood sugar levels. This led me to explore using a CGM device.

**How to get access to CGM?**

In the U.S., a prescription is required for CGM devices like the Freestyle Libre 2. I opted to use a company called
Ageless to streamline the process. Although this option cost a bit more than going through my PCP, it was quick and
hassle-free, which was worth it for me.

Note: As of 2025-01-01, this is no longer necessary. You can buy over the counter version of GCM: Abbott Lingo and Dexcom Stelo!

## Learnings

- **Rice and bread consistently caused glucose spikes** - These foods had a significant impact every time I consumed them.
- **Lattes were unexpectedly problematic** - Even small indulgences could cause noticeable increases.
- **Poor food choices early in the day set the tone** - A bad start often disrupted glucose levels for the entire day.
- **Seemingly innocuous takeout meals caused large spikes** - What appeared harmless wasn’t always so.
- **Better food choices** - Meals like chia pudding, salads, veggie chili, salmon, and broccoli consistently worked well for me.
- **Exercise made a clear difference** - On days I exercised, my blood glucose levels showed a statistically significant drop compared to non-exercise days.
